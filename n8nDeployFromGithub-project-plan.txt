Project Plan: Deploy n8n from GitHub to DigitalOcean App Platform
Name: n8nDeployFromGithub

1) Objective and Scope
- Deploy the open-source n8n workflow automation application from your GitHub repository to DigitalOcean App Platform under the app name "n8nDeployFromGithub".
- Use a stateless runtime with persistent state in a DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL database; consider Spaces (S3-compatible) for binary data only if required and supported.

2) Deployment Strategy
- Preferred: CI/CD via GitHub Actions to deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform using an App Spec file and a DigitalOcean Personal Access Token.
- Alternative: Link the GitHub repository directly in App Platform and deploy from source via control panel.

3) Prerequisites
- DigitalOcean account with App Platform access.
- DigitalOcean Personal Access Token (write permissions for App Platform) stored in GitHub Secrets as DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN.
- App Platform linked to the GitHub account that hosts your fork/mirror of n8n.
- (Optional) Domain/subdomain you control for friendly access URL.
- Local single environment file (e.g., .env) to manage sensitive variables; do not commit to version control.

4) Repository Preparation
- Fork or mirror https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n into your GitHub account.
- Create a deployment folder (e.g., .do/) containing the App Spec file (JSON) describing the App Platform service(s) and environment.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow in the forked repo to deploy the app on push to main.

5) App Platform Service Design (App Spec)
- App Name: n8nDeployFromGithub.
- Region: Choose closest to your users (e.g., nyc, sfo, fra).
- Components: One web service for n8n.
- Build Source: Option A: Build from source (Node.js auto-detection). Option B: Build and push Docker image to DigitalOcean Container Registry (recommended for reproducibility), then reference image in App Spec.
- Runtime: Single instance to start; scale later as needed.
- Health Check: HTTP 200 on base path or a lightweight health path after boot.
- Internal Port: 5678 (n8n default) exposed via App Platform HTTP.

6) Environment Variables and Secrets (examples)
- Core deployment:
  - N8N_PROTOCOL (e.g., https)
  - N8N_HOST (your app domain or App Platform default hostname)
  - N8N_PORT (5678)
  - WEBHOOK_URL (public URL used for registering inbound webhooks)
- Security:
  - N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY (random strong secret to encrypt stored credentials)
- Database (PostgreSQL):
  - Set n8n database variables for Postgres (host, port, database, user, password), and DB type.
- Optional binary storage (advanced/enterprise):
  - S3/Spaces configuration (endpoint/region, bucket, access key/secret) if external storage is needed and supported.

7) DigitalOcean Resources to Provision
- Managed PostgreSQL: Create a cluster, capture connection details (host, port, database, user, password, CA cert if needed).
- (Optional) Spaces bucket: Create bucket, generate access keys if external binary storage is required.
- App Platform Application: Create the app using the App Spec with name n8nDeployFromGithub.

8) CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions)
- Workflow triggers: push to main branch and manual dispatch.
- Steps:
  - Checkout repo.
  - Build (from source) and deploy with DigitalOcean app action; or build Docker image, push to DOCR, then update App Platform using the app action.
- Secrets:
  - DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN stored in GitHub Secrets.

9) Domain, TLS, and Access
- Optionally assign a custom domain/subdomain to the App Platform app.
- Use App Platform-managed certificates or provide your own; ensure HTTPS is enabled.

10) Initial Deployment and Verification
- Run the CI job to create/update the App Platform app.
- Confirm the app reaches running state.
- Access the n8n editor UI via the provided hostname or custom domain.

11) Post-Deploy Validation
- Create a simple test workflow and execute it.
- Verify webhook URLs display correctly and are reachable.
- Validate database persistence by confirming credentials/workflows remain after redeploy.

12) Observability, Backups, and Operations
- Enable alerts in App Platform (deployment failures, resource limits).
- Review logs from App Platform.
- Configure automatic backups for Managed PostgreSQL; test restore procedures.

13) Scaling and Resilience
- Start with single instance; scale up size or count if needed.
- Keep app stateless; avoid writing to local filesystem beyond temporary usage.
- If using multiple instances, ensure externalized storage for any shared state (DB, object storage).

14) Testing and Environment Management
- Create a testing folder structure in the repository for unit/feature tests if needed, with environment configurations for local, development, and production.
- Store sensitive test configuration values in the single local .env file; ensure .env is excluded from commits.
- Run tests before pushing changes that trigger deployment.

15) Risks and Mitigations
- Ephemeral filesystem: use DB and object storage; avoid local persistence.
- Secret management: store sensitive values in GitHub Secrets and App Platform environment; never commit.
- Build/release consistency: prefer container image approach for reproducible deployments.

16) Next Steps
- Confirm this plan.
- After confirmation, proceed to: (1) provision Managed PostgreSQL, (2) prepare App Spec, (3) configure GitHub Action and secrets, (4) perform initial deployment, (5) validate and iterate.
